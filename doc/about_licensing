This document if for general information about the licensing. This may change
over time. This library is currenly an idea with very little written code.

After many hours, it was decided that this library should be licensed under
the GPL. Without going into too many details of the reasoning, this allows
for writing a library which is hoped will benefit the world and the license
sufficiently restricts the freedom of developers such that (I hope)
the code is not taken and integrated into a software project which is only
available to those who can afford it. I hope this library is good enough and
of high enough quality that someone wants this.

That being said, the GPL is only a baseline. I will relicense the code,
for as long as I am able, on a case-by-case basis, specifically for other
free software projects which do not want the restrictions the GPL imposes.
